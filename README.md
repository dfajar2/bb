bb stands for black box

the program bb is a program to list the other programs in the project,
type bb for a list of all programs, or bb sometext for a grep-like limit
to the list of programs returned.
Due to poor programming on my part, it assumes that programs are
installed in /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/bb
