bb
--

The program bb is a program to list the other programs in the project with a short
one or two line summary of the program.

Type bb for a list of all programs, or bb followed by some text for a grep-like limit
to the list of programs returned.
Due to poor programming on my part, bb assumes that programs are
installed in /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/bb

bb.motif
--------

This program was used to generate a supplemental file for the publication:

Marina Iovene, Pablo F. Cavagnaro, Douglas Senalik, C. Robin Buell, Jiming Jiang and Philipp W. Simon<br>
Comparative FISH mapping of Daucus species (Apiaceae family)

[Chromosome Research Volume 19, Number 4, 493-506](http://www.springerlink.com/content/y73j6m3133n16773/)
DOI: 10.1007/s10577-011-9202-y

For more details see http://www.vcru.wisc.edu/simonlab/sdata/software/index.html#motif

bb.orffinder
------------

This is a Perl program that will computationally detect open reading frames in DNA or RNA sequences in FASTA format.
This is computationally similar to the NCBI program at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/orfig.cgi,
but allows command-line automation of the process, as well as a few additional features.

For more details see http://www.vcru.wisc.edu/simonlab/sdata/software/index.html#orffinder

bb.fastareorder
---------------

This program will allow changing the order or orientation of multiple sequences
in FASTA format, or extraction of a subset of sequences. The resulting sequences
can optionally be concatenated into a single sequence.

For more details see http://www.vcru.wisc.edu/simonlab/sdata/software/index.html#fastareorder

bb.454contignet
---------------

This is a Perl program that will take an assembly of Roche 454 sequences generated by the
Roche newbler/gsAssembler, and use the connection information to link generated contigs
into a graphical map.

bb.454contiginfo
----------------

This is a Perl program that will take an assembly of Roche 454 sequences generated by the
Roche newbler/gsAssembler, and displays all information for one or more specified contigs,
in particular, the connection and read flowthrough information.
